Code style and formatting
=========================
Please adhere to the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_ 
as closely as possible, with the following exception:

Docstrings must follow the `Numpy Style Guide <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_, 
as the docstrings are parsed using ``numpydoc`` to produce the documentation.
