Introduction
============

This documentation, in its current form, is simply an API Reference for the CUED DataLogger developers.

Hopefully at some point it will develop to include a full manual and other such exciting things.

See the :doc:`/quickstart` for how to get the DataLogger up and running, and :doc:`/using` for more detailed
information on how to use the DataLogger.
